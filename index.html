            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I was born in York, PA in May of 1985.  My family moved to Danvers, MA in the Greater Boston Area in 1992 when my dad got a job as the Assistant Director of Respiratory Therapy at Mass General Hospital. I graduated high school in 2003 and went to Simmons College in Boston, MA to pursue a degree in Neuroscience.  I graduated college in 2007, expecting to take a couple years off before appling to grad school, hoping to continue with research in cognitive/behavioral neuroscience.</p>  
            <p>I was given the opportunity to work in a Sleep Research Lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, MA as a research assistant.  I was sent to a training program to become a Registerd Polysomnologic Technologist (RPSGT), or "Sleep Tech" and have been working in the field ever since.  I started as an entry level research assistant, and will be ending my career in the Sleep Research as a Senior Research Lab Manager. </p>
            <p>Working for almost 14 years in a sleep research lab was both fulfilling and challenging, and I am great to have the experiences I did learning every aspect of running a research lab, from grant writing to publication, and everything in between (recruitment, data collection, and data analysis).  I was amn intergral part of a team of researchers who are regarded as the best in their field.  Regardless of my previous position in a globally respected research lab, I still feel an urge to pursue something new.  Which brings me to coding!</p>
            <p>I know many people who have changed careers to coding after being in a steady career for many years.  Everyone I talk to agrees, coding is lucrartive field that is challenging just as much as it is rewarding.  And I can't wait to find out for myself!</p>

            <p>Let's face it, when you have a full time job and a young child, you don't have any time to focus on a hobby, but whenever I find myself with a little extra time, I try to stay busy with some sort of fun project.</p>
